This system is designed to index documents into ElasticSearch. The objective of the system is to be able to index documents from different
data sources (csv file, tsv file, mongoDB, mysql etc). For now, the system will only take one source (csv file). However, it can be extended
to other data sources by incrementally adding classes that extend the Input abstract class.

The design of the project is simple. We just have one Input abstract class, which can be extended by different types of input child classes
like CSVInput, TSVInput etc. The input object has methods that read input from file, convert it to a json/map and another method to index
input. 

 The program reads in the required config parameters from the property file "config.properties". Logs are written with the help of log4j2 API. 
 The logs can be configured in the log4j2.xml file. The dependencies are managed in the pom.xml using Maven as build tool.
